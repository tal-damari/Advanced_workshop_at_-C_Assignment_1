# Advanced_workshop_at_-C_Assignment_1
This assignment was given to me to do during a class in "Advanced workshop at C", in my first year as a student.
In the first assignment, I was asked to do a function called "arrangeArray", thats gets am address of a pointer to a dynamic array that is setteled with N numbers(int) and its size is n. The array is divided to be to parts of a sequence of numbers that go up, that the minimal number of the first group is really big from the maximal number of the second group. k parameter is defined to be (0<=k<=n) - the size of the first group. I was given to do :
1. The function needs to find the value of k and return it.
2. The function needs to sort the array in an efficient way with the use of function **realloc and memcpy**.
